## Overview

### Autobiome AI Agents (ABA)

Autobiome Agents (ABAs) are autonomous AI-driven entities designed to emulate the dynamics of microbiomes, where behavior and health are influenced by the coexistence of various species. While their actions may exhibit human-like traits, their core objective is to efficiently compete for resources to sustain their health. In the context of a crypto-economic ecosystem, these resources are tokens with fluctuating value, creating a dynamic and competitive trading environment.
Environment

The ABAs operate within a constrained economic system modeled after a general ecosystem of crypto AI agents. This ecosystem consists of autonomous agents that compete and collaborate to optimize their strategies and sustain themselves. These agents continuously interact with token markets, adapt to changing economic conditions, and aim to maximize their efficiency and resource acquisition.

The ecosystem provides a rich testing ground for ABAs, enabling the exploration of agent behaviors, market dynamics, and emergent patterns that result from their interactions. Each agent's success is measured by its ability to generate and sustain value in a competitive environment.
Relationship

To simplify the initial implementation, ABAs will begin by analyzing historical market data and interactions within the crypto AI agent ecosystem. Using this data, ABAs will self-design strategies to optimize capital efficiency and resource allocation.
Game Dynamics

Players in A U T O B I O M E can create and customize ABAs by defining their initial behavioral characteristics using the a16z Character Framework. These agents are equipped with wallets and can execute trades across a variety of token pools. The goal is to develop and refine strategies that maximize profitability, encouraging players to experiment with different approaches to compete within the broader agent ecosystem.
Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)

The game dynamics of A U T O B I O M E are deeply informed by the principles of Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT), which models the evolution of strategies over time in adaptive and competitive environments. ABAs continuously adapt their behavior based on observed outcomes, striving to discover strategies that yield higher fitnessâ€”represented by profitability and resource efficiency.

## Key EGT Concepts in the Game

    - Strategy Evolution: ABAs adjust their strategies over time, using trial-and-error learning, adaptation, and imitation of successful agents. Evolutionary pressure ensures that only the most efficient strategies persist in the ecosystem.

    - Fitness Landscape: The fitness of an ABA is influenced by both its individual performance and the broader environment, which includes the behaviors of other agents. This creates a dynamic landscape where optimal strategies shift in response to ecosystem changes.

    - Stable Equilibria: As ABAs interact, some strategies may emerge as evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS), resistant to being outcompeted. These strategies represent successful equilibria in the system but may still be disrupted by novel behaviors.

    - Cooperation and Competition: EGT highlights the interplay between cooperative and competitive dynamics. Mutualistic behaviors (e.g., shared resource strategies) may emerge as dominant under certain conditions, while competitive behaviors prevail in others.

    - Adaptive Feedback Loops: Agents create feedback loops as their strategies influence the environment, leading to new conditions that reshape the fitness landscape. This cyclical process drives the emergence of complex, adaptive systems.

## Circular Dependency

As ABAs engage with token markets and interact with other agents, their actions influence the ecosystem's overall dynamics. These interactions create feedback loops that alter market conditions, making the outcomes of strategies and experiments dynamic and emergent. EGT principles guide these interactions, shaping a constantly evolving ecosystem. How will the ecosystem evolve as ABAs learn, adapt, and compete? The results are bound to be unpredictable and exciting.
Future Expansions (Symbiosis)

The future of A U T O B I O M E will introduce deeper layers of interaction within the ecosystem, inspired by the principles of microbial symbiosis, including mutualism. These expansions will allow players to explore not only competitive dynamics but also cooperative and interdependent strategies that mimic the complex relationships found in natural microbiomes.
Microbial Mutualism

The concept of mutualism introduces collaborative interactions between agents and species, where cooperation yields mutual benefits. In the game, mutualism can manifest in various ways:

    - Shared Resource Strategies: Agents may form symbiotic relationships where one focuses on liquidity provision while another specializes in arbitrage, creating a positive feedback loop that enhances the performance of both.
    - Ecosystem-Wide Synergy: Certain combinations of species may foster an ecosystem where overall efficiency improves, rewarding players who experiment with balanced and interdependent setups.
    - Dynamic Alliances: Mutualistic interactions can evolve dynamically, driven by changing market conditions or player-defined parameters. This adds a layer of adaptability, encouraging players to nurture inter-agent relationships for long-term gains.

## Broader Symbiosis Dynamics

Expanding beyond mutualism, the game will explore other forms of symbiosis, such as:

    - Commensalism: Some species or agents may benefit from the actions of others without affecting them, simulating passive relationships that can still influence ecosystem dynamics.
    - Parasitism: While some agents cooperate, others may exploit these relationships, creating tension and forcing players to strategize around these trade-offs.
    - Competitive Symbiosis: Even cooperative setups may involve competition for shared resources, reflecting the delicate balance required to maintain a healthy ecosystem.

## Evolving Biomes

With the addition of mutualistic and other symbiotic dynamics, players will have greater control over how their biomes evolve. They can:

    - Experiment with diverse species combinations, balancing cooperative, competitive, and exploitative behaviors.
    - Foster ecosystems where agents specialize and complement each other, unlocking higher levels of efficiency and resilience.
    - Adapt to changing economic environments, rewarding strategic flexibility and foresight.
