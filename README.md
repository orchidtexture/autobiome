# A U T O B I O M E

**A U T O B I O M E** is a microbiome-inspired trading game that transforms liquidity pools and trading activity into a dynamic, interactive ecosystem. Players take on the role of macroorganisms, represented by AI agents, navigating a vibrant digital world of gut-like environments, populated by evolving species of bots.

## Concept Overview

### Environments: Liquidity Pools
The core environments of **A U T O B I O M E** are existing liquidity pools from platforms like Uniswap. These pools serve as ecosystems within a virtual gut microbiome, defined by:
- **Profit Potential**: A score reflecting the attractiveness of a trade.
- **Ecosystem Health**: A general indicator of the pool’s stability and activity.

Players interact with these pools to trade tokens, exploring diverse environments with varying levels of risk and reward.

### Players: Macroorganism AI Agents
Players are macroorganisms represented by **AI agents**, their customizable avatars in the game. These agents:
- Execute trades and explore ecosystems autonomously based on player-configured strategies.
- Evolve over time, gaining new traits, abilities, and visual enhancements.
- Are tokenized as NFTs, allowing players to own, trade, and upgrade their agents.

### Species: Bacteria Bots
**Bacteria bots** are the first species introduced into the ecosystem, adding depth to gameplay. These bots interact with liquidity pools by:
- **Beneficial Bacteria**: Stabilizing ecosystems and improving trading conditions.
- **Harmful Bacteria**: Disrupting pool stability, creating high-risk scenarios.
- **Opportunistic Bacteria**: Capitalizing on volatility, generating unpredictable dynamics.

Players must adapt to bacteria behaviors, influencing pool health and profitability through their actions.
